# SpinSolve2TopSpin
NMR data converter from SpinSolve (Magritek) to TopSpin (Bruker)

Converts 2D data from SpinSolve Expert to TopSpin.
Tested for 1H-13C and 1H-1H spectra from 43 MHz and 80 MHz Magritek spectrometers and TopSpin 4.5.

After converting run xfb and sref in TopSpin to get the spectrum with proper referencing.

Currently, apodzation is NOT transferred from the Magritek proc.par file.
